      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a frontend developer with a strong focus on building clean, simple, and responsive user interfaces. I care about how things look and feel, but also how they work. I believe good design is not just about visuals â€” it's about making things easy and enjoyable to          use.
      </p>
      <p>I like to keep things simple, both in code and in design. I work hard to write code that's easy to read, easy to maintain, and performs well. I pay attention to detail, especially when it comes to layout, spacing, and how users interact with a page.</p>
      <p>I'm always learning. Whether it's a new design trend or a new tool that can help improve the user experience, I'm interested. I believe the best developers are always growing and staying curious.</p>
